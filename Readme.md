# Octopus Checkers
Welcome to Octopus Checkers. This is just a regular game of checkers. Nothing out of the ordinary here.

## Rules
### Objective
The objective of the game is to capture all of the opponent's pieces. You win when 12 of your opponent's pieces are in jail.

### Movement
Typically, pieces must move forward 1 AND laterally 1 space per turn. There are two exceptions.

#### Capturing
Pieces capture opponent's pieces by jumping over them diagonally. A piece can move forward 2 and laterally 2 if and only if an opponent's piece in between its origin and destination.

#### Crowned
When a piece reaches the opposite end of the board from which it started, it is crowned (purple pieces become blue; orange become red). Crowned pieces can move backwards or forwards.

## Modes
The game is currently configured for two human players at the same computer, or one human player playing as both sides.

## Controls
### Simple moves
When it's your turn, click one of your pieces. The piece should highlight. Then click the square to which you want the piece to move.

### Double+ jumps
Once your piece is highlighted, hold down Shift to select multiple tiles to jump over/capture multiple opponents. Your move will begin when you release Shift. (If it doesn't, your move was not allowed.)
